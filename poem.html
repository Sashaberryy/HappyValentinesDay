      <h2 class="poem-title"><i>F</i>eelings, Undenied</h2>
      <p><b>I</b> cannot fathom how things turned out this way.</p>
      <p><b>L</b>iking you is one thing, but loving you is another.</p>
      <p><b>O</b>ver and over I ask myself,</p>
      <p><b>V</b>oices in my head keeps telling me to stop.</p>
      <p><b>E</b>ven with all that, I know for sure.</p>
      <p><b>Y</b>ou are indeed someone I fancy.</p>
      <p><b>O</b>ver and over I swore to the moon and star,</p>
      <p><b>U</b>nderneath the starry sky I’ll love you with all my heart.</p>

    <!-- Card 2 -->
    <div class="poem-card" id="card-1">
      <h2 class="poem-title"><i>R</i>oses in the Moonlight</h2>
      <p>
        A bud of light flourished into something great,<br>
        Started as friendship now something more.<br>
        Confused and afraid with an empty plate,<br>
        Now filled with warmth with an open door.
      </p>
      <p>
        I step back as I deny myself,<br>
        But the moon and stars told me otherwise.<br>
        Like a book left untouched on the bookshelf,<br>
        Once touched and you’ll become wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tall and thick walls were built out of fear,<br>
        In purpose of protecting my once fragile heart.<br>
        Walls now open and I can see it clear,<br>
        What it really meant to see a true art.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was you who revived once dead lovergirl,<br>
        Met with a bond as precious as pearl.

    <div class="poem-card" id="card-2">
      <h2 class="poem-title"><i>A</i>ll or Nothing</h2>
      <p>
        If my love for you ruins me, so be it.<br>
        My heart yearns heavily like you’re all I need.<br>
        You slide into my broken pieces like you were meant to fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        You set my heart ablaze and my nightmares lit.<br>
        Burned and discarded every warning I intend to read.<br>
        If my love for you ruins me, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Slowly filling my empty cup bit by bit,<br>
        My love for you feels like hunger no one else could feed.<br>
        You slide into my broken pieces like you were meant to fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ripping my heart open I must commit,<br>
        For I have planted my lover’s seed.<br>
        If my love for you ruins me, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am impulsive and obsessed I must admit,<br>
        Though I am certain that my love for you is true indeed.<br>
        You slide into my broken pieces like you were meant to fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love commits to flames where shadows sit,<br>
        Your gaze feeds the fire I cannot concede.<br>
        If my love for you ruins me, so be it.<br>
        You slide into my broken pieces like you were meant to fit.

      <h2 class="poem-title"><i>N</i>ot a Love Confession</h2>
      <p>
        This is not a love confession,<br>
        But you’re already part of my daily life.<br>
        The constant messages and gaming sessions.<br>
        It’s something I look forward to everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a love confession,<br>
        But I saw something unexpected.<br>
        How a broken soul be so beautiful.<br>
        A bittersweet beauty indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a love confession,<br>
        Yet you’ve shown me colors,<br>
        Colors I haven’t seen before.<br>
        Unanticipated, unpredicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a love confession,<br>
        But you gave me warmth,<br>
        You made me smile.<br>
        You are my happy pill indeed.
